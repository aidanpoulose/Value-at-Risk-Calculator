Overview
This repository contains Python scripts to calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR) for stocks and portfolios using historical price data. VaR is a widely used risk metric that estimates the maximum expected loss over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level.

There are two calculators included:
Single-Stock VaR Calculator – Estimates potential loss for an individual stock.
Multi-Stock Portfolio VaR Calculator – Estimates potential loss for a portfolio of multiple stocks, weighted by investment amounts.

Both are built from scratch for educational purposes and demonstrate practical risk estimation techniques.

Features:
-Fetches historical stock prices using yfinance.
-Computes daily returns manually for accurate control over calculations.
-Supports 1-day and 1-week horizons for single-stock VaR.
-Handles weighted multi-stock portfolios with manual return aggregation.
-Provides clear error messages.
